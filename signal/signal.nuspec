    <description><![CDATA[Signal is an encrypted communications application. It uses the Internet to 
send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes, images and videos, and 
make one-to-one voice and video calls.

## Features
 - Create a group or edit group details right from your Desktop. You only need to grab your phone (along with your car keys) after the new "Brunch Crew" reaches a decision.
 - We redesigned the Desktop voice message interface to look just as good as your friends and family sound. Voice messages no longer stop playing when you scroll within the same chat, so you can listen to the past without leaving the present behind.
 - Look for the familiar pencil compose button to quickly start a new chat instead of searching for one that hasn't even started.
 - Every chat header has a cleaner look, but additional details are still only a single click away.
 - Performance improvements let you switch between chats faster than ever.
 
To install to a custom location please use following syntax,
```
# choco install signal-beta --pre --install-args "'/D=D:\MyApps\signal'" --confirm
```

To start signal with tray support, please add following argument,
```
$ & 'signal beta.exe' --use-tray-icon --start-in-tray
```
